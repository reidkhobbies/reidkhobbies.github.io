Hello This is a peronsal website for Reid Kush. I am going to shares some of hobbies on here starting with some of favorite food to cook. The recipe is as follows I hope you enjoy!

For a delicious and flavorful grilled meal, marinate chicken breasts in a blend of olive oil, garlic salt, paprika, and black pepper. Stuff the chicken with mozzarella cheese to add a rich, creamy texture. Grill the chicken over medium heat, around 275°F, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F, which typically takes about 12-15 minutes per side depending on thickness. Alongside, grill asparagus and cut peppers drizzled with olive oil until tender and slightly charred, about 4-6 minutes. The result is a savory, well-balanced dish where the juicy chicken is complemented by the melted mozzarella. The paprika and garlic salt provide a depth of flavor. The asparagus adds a delightful, slightly smoky crunch, making for a perfectly grilled meal. Try it for yourself and I hope you enjoy!
